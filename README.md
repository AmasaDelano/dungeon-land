# Dungeon Land

Version 1.5.0.1 beta

## About

Dungeon Land (V1.5) is a revised version of the [Dungeon World](https://dungeon-world.com) tabletop roleplaying game, keeping the exact same rules but making the text clearer to new and old players alike.

If you have suggestions, please submit a pull request or [open a new issue](https://github.com/AmasaDelano/dungeon-world-revised/issues). You can also discuss suggestions on the [Dungeon World Discord](https://discord.gg/8nPub3tjG2), under the `#hacking-pbta` channel.

## Goals

Future updates to Dungeon Land will be made based on how well they accomplish these goals:

1. To adhere to the original rules of Dungeon World, only modifying rules where doing so makes the original rules clearer or easier to remember.
2. To make the rules of Dungeon World clear and easy-to-understand.
3. To keep the learning curve flat, so new players can learn and understand how to play Dungeon World without reading any other documents, especially players who have never played either Dungeons & Dragons or Apocalypse World.
4. To give clear and consistent definitions of terms which can be easily referred to.
