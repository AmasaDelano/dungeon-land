## Goals

Future updates to Dungeon World Revised will be made based on how well they accomplish these goals:

1. To make the rules of Dungeon World clear and easy-to-understand.
2. To keep the learning curve flat, so new players can learn and understand how to play Dungeon World without reading any other documents, especially players who have never played either Dungeons & Dragons or Apocalypse World.
3. To give clear and consistent definitions of terms which can be easily referred to.
4. To adhere to the original rules of Dungeon World, only modifying rules where doing so makes the original rules clearer or easier to remember.
